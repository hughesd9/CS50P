Functions and variables

In order to run programs in terminal: python <filename>.py
Function = action/verb that lets you do something in the program.
Programming languages have built in functions that it know how to do for you. e.g print()
Arguments = input to a function that influences it's behaviour e.g the "hello, world" in print("hello, world")
Return value = output of a function
Variables = store a value in computer's memory
The equals sign (=) is known as assignment, it assigns a value to a variable
Can pass variables as arguments to functions
Comments are notes to yourself in your code, in python you use #
Can pass multiple arguments to certain functions by using commas to separate the arguments
Parameters = what you CAN pass through a function
Named parameters are optional parameters that you can pass to a function
Backslash (\) is an escape character in the print function
Format string formats stuff in a string in a special way but using {} in strings, e.g {name}
Need to specify this in the argument of print, e.g print(f"hello, {name}")
This will then pick up the variable and use it in the function
There are methods belonging to each type in python, e.g strings have the .strip() method to strip whitespaces from either side of letters
You can also chain methods together, e.g name = name.strip().title()
